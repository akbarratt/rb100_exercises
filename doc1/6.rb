#  Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a Symbol that represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of ruby's datatypes.

# The symbol documentation is also on the page for literals. Symbols are denoted by a prefixed colong :my_symbol. They can also be interpolated, using double quotes.
